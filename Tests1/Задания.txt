Задание 1:
	Create a simple String calculator with a method int sum(string numbers)
	The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an
	empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”.
	Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and 2
	numbers.
	Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to
	write tests you did not think about.
	Remember to refactor  after each passing test

Задание 2:
	Allow the sum-method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
